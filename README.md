## General Information

A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.
 ## Buisness Problem
 
 You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

## Conclusions
-GrLivArea,OverallQual,Neighborhood_NoRidge,2ndFlrSF are variables which have high positive impact on the target variable.
-BsmtQual_Gd,KitchenQual_TA,KitchenQual_Gd are variables which have high negative impact on target variable.
-We will proceed with lasso instead of ridge because it eliminates most of the features and accuracy is also.
